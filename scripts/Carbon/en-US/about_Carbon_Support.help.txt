SHORT DESCRIPTION
    This topic describes how you can get help using Carbon.
    
OVERVIEW
    Remember, Carbon is open-source software, and comes "as is", ***without 
    warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied***. The Carbon 
    users and developers are volunteering to help you. Please respect their time and
    assistance. 

CHAT
    Carbon has a [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/splatteredbits/Carbon/) you can 
    use to ask questions and get help. The project owner/maintainer usually hangs out 
    there during business hours, Monday through Friday. He's in the Pacific time zone. 
    You'll need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account to login and ask questions.

E-MAIL
    Carbon has a mailing list: [carbon@freelists.org](mailto:carbon@freelists.org). You 
    don't need to subscribe to ask questions, but you do need to subscribe to be part of
    the community and answer questions. [Subscribe to the list.](http://www.freelists.org/list/carbon).
